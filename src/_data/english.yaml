  As an expert on this subject, I admit that German is a tricky language, even for native speakers. No matter what kind of text you are going to publish, please do not hesitate to seek advice from professionals in this field.


  **Proofreading/final editing:** Correcting orthography, grammar, and punctuation.


  **Copy editing:** This is all about comprehensibility and reading pleasure. Is the wording adequate? Do some sentences need to be simplified? I will perfect the style and the structure of the script. And if you want me to, I will have a look at the content — maybe some information should be changed according to the German context.


  **Translation editing:** I will compare English original and German translation for semantic errors.


  **Adaptation:** Do you want an advertising slogan to be adapted from English or French into German? While rewriting your slogan, I will make sure it hits the mark.


  **Copy writing:** Promotion brochure, newsletter, booklet, flyer, mailing, advertising slogan, or web content — I will find the words to reach your audience.


  **Political communication:** Especially non-governmental organisations, public administrations, and PR agencies appreciate my experience in creating content related to political campaigns and informative literature.
